Our next meeting will be this Saturday October 1st at 2 PM. The location of the meeting will be in the Campus Center in room 168 C.
During this meeting we will be playing Dorm Wars! In this event we will split people into teams based on where they live on campus. (People off-campus are included too!)
The top team that wins will earn an arcade riven skin and if you own the skin already you can swap it out for a lanyard or wristband.
During this meeting we will also be playing in house games, so if you aren't interested in Dorm Wars you can still come and play some casual games together.
